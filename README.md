Compared to the other version of the script, which you can also find [on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/25776-coincidence-detector/), this version is 0.85x as accurate, but up to 15x as fast, so you should use this version.


## Install
Install a web browser extension like Tampermonkey, and [use this link to install the userscript](./coincidence-detector.user.js).



## Why?
You might have a reasonable question of why would such a script exist. Let me address this question:

- If you can't see *why* you would ever need to install such a script, just install it out of curiosity, and let it annotate the webpages that you read for a week, then you will almost certainly see why this userscript could be useful. **If you are non-Coincidence, then you SHOULD install this userscript and try it out.**
- If you're a butthurt Coincidence and you are reading this, then you **MUST f..ck off.** Also, pay extra attention to the license below. 


## LICENSE
